# üöÄ Interactive Digital Portfolio

A dynamic, fully responsive personal portfolio website built exclusively with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to showcase skills, projects, and interactive front-end development capabilities.

## üåü Project Overview

This project was developed as a Capstone Submission for the **IBM Skillbuild Edunet** program.

The goal was to move beyond the limitations of a traditional, static resume by creating a live, interactive platform that directly demonstrates proficiency in core web technologies and modern UI/UX design.

### Problem Statement

Many developers struggle to present their practical skills (like responsiveness, complex animations, and interactive design) effectively in a static document. This project solves that by providing a highly engaging, custom-coded platform to visually communicate technical abilities.

### Key Features Implemented

* **Smooth Navigation:** Fixed header and smooth scrolling behavior between sections.
* **Dynamic Typing Effect:** A custom JavaScript function to cycle and type out professional roles on the Home screen.
* **High-Performance Animations:** Image floating effects implemented using `requestAnimationFrame`.
* **Responsive Design:** Full adaptability across mobile, tablet, and desktop views using CSS Media Queries.
* **Skills Visualization:** Animated progress bars triggered when the section scrolls into view using the **Intersection Observer API**.
* **Interactive Feedback:** Custom ripple effect on the Contact button.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project strictly adheres to the core front-end technology requirement, using no external frameworks or libraries beyond standard helper utilities.

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and content organization.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, responsiveness (Flexbox/Grid), and animation keyframes.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** All logic for interactivity, scrolling, animations, and user experience.

### External Libraries/Tools:

* **ScrollReveal.js:** Used for clean, staggered entrance animations on section elements.
* **Boxicons:** Used for all scalable vector icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, navigation icons, etc.).
